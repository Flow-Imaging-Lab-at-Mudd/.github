## Flow Imaging Lab at Mudd

### About Us

The Flow Imaging Lab at Mudd (FILM) is directed by Prof. Leah Mendelson. Our public github page contains software for fluid flow imaging, 3D PIV data post-processing, and multi-camera imaging. We maintain a fork of the openfv library for light field imaging and synthetic aperture particle image velocimetry (SAPIV) for development; the latest stable release of openfv can be obtained from https://github.com/abhishekbajpayee/openfv.

We are part of the Engineering department at Harvey Mudd College. We welcome research group members of all majors and 5C affiliations. 5C students interested in joining FILM should contact Prof. Mendelson directly.
